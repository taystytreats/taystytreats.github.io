          <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Taylor I’ve had the heart of an entrepreneur from the very beginning. My passion for baking and cake decorating started
              in my early teenage years when my mother took me to a cake pop class. Since then I’ve learned the art of designing in decorating cakes and cake pops for family and close friends.
              To now growing my own business!!! I specialize in artistic edibles
              such as custom cakes, cupcakes, cake pops and other items.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              My main goal is to offer 100% customized high-quality cakes for any occasion and any size. There’s no party without a custom cake from TAYsty Treats!
              I make incredible cakes with unforgettable design and flavor fit for your taste and style.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel my edge in the cake community Within the Houston, Texas area with my design skills, eye for precision and my perfectionism to truly personalize each
              treats because it’s the details that really matter. And can't forget the yummy taste!!!!!!!
              Please remember I am a home baker, therefore I do things a bit differently.  First take advantage of the links I have provided for you, it should get you started in the right direction.
